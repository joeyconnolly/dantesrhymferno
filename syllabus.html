            <h1>Curricular Architecture: The Path of Poetic Inquiry</h1>
            <p>A carefully structured journey through twelve dimensions of poetic craft, each building upon the foundations established in previous sessions. This evolving framework mirrors the recursive nature of poetic thinking itself—where each new insight necessitates the revisiting and deepening of fundamental principles.</p>

                        <p>This inaugural module interrogates the nature of imagery in poetry, moving beyond reductive conceptions of description to explore how images function as epistemological instruments—ways of knowing and experiencing reality that transcend simple visual representation. We examine how poets transform phenomenological encounters into complex symbolic frameworks that simultaneously engage the senses and intellect.</p>

                            <h4>Textual Exploration: "The Idea of Order at Key West" by Wallace Stevens</h4>
                            <p>Stevens' meditation on artistic creation presents a profound philosophical inquiry into the relationship between human consciousness and external reality. The poem's central tension—between the raw, indifferent power of the ocean and the woman's transformative song—becomes a metapoetic commentary on how art imposes meaningful patterns upon chaotic experience.</p>
                            <div class="poet-info">Wallace Stevens (1879–1955) was an American modernist whose work consistently explores the nature of reality and imagination, positioning poetry as a supreme fiction that both acknowledges and transcends the limitations of human understanding.</div>

                            <h4>Textual Exploration: "Ariel" by Sylvia Plath</h4>
                            <p>In this kinetic, transformative work, Plath presents a complex psychodrama of identity dissolution and reconstruction through intensely physical imagery. The poem functions as a phenomenological record of consciousness in flux, where the boundaries between self and world become increasingly permeable.</p>
                            <div class="poet-info">Sylvia Plath (1932–1963) revolutionized confessional poetry through her unflinching examination of psychological states and her distinctive fusion of mythic symbolism with intensely personal experience.</div>

                            <h4>Textual Exploration: "The Street" by Octavio Paz</h4>
                            <p>Paz constructs a minimalist yet profound meditation on existential quest, using the image of an endless street as both literal setting and metaphysical framework. The poem's sparse architecture belies its philosophical complexity—the persistent pursuit of a shadow that remains perpetually beyond reach becomes an allegory for consciousness itself.</p>
                            <div class="poet-info">Octavio Paz (1914–1998), Mexican poet and Nobel laureate, consistently explored the intersections of time, language, and being throughout his work, creating a distinctive poetics that bridged Western and non-Western philosophical traditions.</div>

                            <p>Hopkins' revolutionary "sprung rhythm" and dense phonetic patterning create a sonic experience that mirrors the kinetic energy of the falcon's flight. Through intricate alliteration, assonance, and consonance, he achieves a compression of sound that embodies rather than merely describes his subject, creating what he called "inscape"—the unique interior essence of a thing made perceptible.</p>

                        <p>Our concluding module examines the crucial role of revision in poetic creation, understanding editing not as mere correction but as a deepening of vision—a re-seeing that clarifies and intensifies the original impulse. Through studying poets' manuscripts and multiple versions, we explore how the recursive process of revision embodies a dialogue between initial inspiration and critical consciousness.</p>

                            <h4>Textual Exploration: "Diving into the Wreck" by Adrienne Rich</h4>
                            <p>Rich's iconic poem, viewed alongside earlier drafts, reveals how precision emerges through the elimination of the extraneous and the careful calibration of metaphorical registers. The poem's exploration of personal and cultural archaeology parallels the revisionary process itself—a diving into the submerged structures of language to recover essential meaning.</p>
                            <div class="poet-info">Adrienne Rich (1929–2012) was renowned for her evolving poetic voice, which increasingly aligned poetic form with political consciousness through rigorous revisionary practice.</div>
